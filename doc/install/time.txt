TIME

It is important for both the sensor and analysis machines to have the 
correct time, so, be sure to set the correct time zone on each machine  
using the tzsetup(8) utility, execute "ntpdate pool.ntp.org" as root to 
set the machines' clocks to the correct time, and configure an NTP 
daemon to keep them in sync.

One such daemon is OpenNTPD. To install and  configure it, once each machine
has a ports tree, cd to "/usr/ports/net/openntpd/", and, as root, execute "make 
install clean". Then, add the following lines to /etc/rc.conf:

openntpd_enable="YES"
openntpd_flags="-s"

Finally, as root, execute "/usr/local/etc/rc.d/openntpd start" to start 
it.
