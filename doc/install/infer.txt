Installing INFER

Installing INFER onto a dedicated physical machine has been completely
automated, and consists of just a few steps.

First, make sure you have installed FreeBSD as documented in freebsd.txt
and that you have followed the instructions in time.txt for setting up
NTP and adjusting the timezone accordingly.

Second, make sure you are root. If you are not, become root.

# sh -c 'if [ $(whoami) != root ] ; then su - ; fi;'

Next, extract the source tree tarball somewhere.

# cd /root
# tar xf source_tree.tar

Change directory to the src directory in the tree.

# cd ims-site/trunk/src

Copy the install script(s) into a directory in your PATH.

# cp bin/scripts/infer_{install,database}* /usr/local/bin/

Next, modify all of the configuration options in the install script.

# vim /usr/local/bin/infer_install.sh

...

Finally, execute the script.

# sh /usr/local/bin/infer_install.sh
