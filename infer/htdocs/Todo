Front Page:
===========

Host Page:
==========
	* Content Distribution:
	-----------------------
		- Content distribution table should be sorted, with most in/outbound
		content on the top.
		- There is no need for the pie-charts, information presented is
		reptitive.

	* Host Activity:
    ----------------	
		- We need to add a host activity graph for the past 24-hours. The graph
		basically plots amount of data in and out of a host for every 30-minute 
		interval. We can even include content types by coloring the bars
		accordingly.

	* Popular Services:
	-------------------
		- Popular services and host roles should be merged. They are
		essentially the same thing. Instead of popular services, all the
		information currently under this category should come under "Host
		Roles." For example:
			* Consumer		400MB 	from 8:47:58 to 23:45:06 14 hosts
				- Mail Client	10MB 	from 9:00:32 to 10:20:09 from 13 hosts
				- Web Client	20MB 	from 10:10:12 to 12:00:00 from 2 hosts

			* Producer		320MB	from 12:00:20 to 13:34:25 to 2300 hosts
				- Mail Server 	300MB from 12:00:20 to 13:34:25 to 2300 hosts

			* Relay			1.5GB	from 9:00:00 to 15:09:45	between 1500 hosts
				- Multimedia P2P Node	from 12:00:20 to 13:34:25 between 500 hosts
				- Malicious P2P Node	from 11:00:21 to 12:00:21 between 1025 hosts

	* Infection Report:
	-------------------
		- If we find a diagnostics then we should only present the diagnostics.
		There should be no symptoms listed with diagnostics because it is noise
		at that point.

		- Need to display host rank, virulence etc. in a nicer way. Currently
		it is a mess!!

Front Page:
===========
	- Rename column "Symptoms" to "Symptoms/Diagnostics"
	- Rename column "Reaction" as "Action".
	- Integrate "Inform" user with the email address from LDAP and it sends out
	an email when clicked.
	- Top-N table should occupy only one line per host, no more than that!
	- Too many symptoms showing up on front page. Remove unneccessary symptoms
	or display only most important ones.
		-- There should be a list which a user can use to prioritize the
		symptoms.
	- Whenever hosts have domain name display only domain names and mouse over
	tooltip can display the IP address.
	- We need network summary graphs that gives a user snap shot of how the
	network is doing.
		- Network activity graph: Plots the amount of data in and out of network
	   	for every 30-minute interval for the past 24-hours. Just like the host 
		activity graph this can also show content type distribution on each bar
		of the graph.
		- Network bandwidth graph: Basically a simple line graph of
		inbound/outbound traffic for the past month or quater (4 months).
		- Network reputation graph: Reputation of the network over the past
		month or 4 months.
