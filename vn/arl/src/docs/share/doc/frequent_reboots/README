DESCRIPTION
     FrequentReboots program scans through the netflow data file to flag
     hosts that are considered to reboot too often. The user defined
     parameters are used as the criteria. A reboot is determined
     based on specific events that are associated with a host's
     initiation process. This includes things like checking for
     updates, connecting to the time server, etc. These events can
     be configured by the user.

     The program can also read DNS data from PCAP files and leverage
     the host events based on DNS names. It is assumed that most DNS
     requests will be proxied, so rules on responses are loosened.
     As long as a DNS response was seen for a specific IP then
     connections to that are IP are tied to the DNS name in the
     response.

     The output of the program shows the flow that was the "last
     straw." Basically it's the flow that triggered off the event.
     The Client IP represents the violating host. A host that
     reboots too often is considered unstable and/or infected.

     If configuration_file is not specified, the default configuration
     file location is /usr/local/etc/symptoms.conf.

     The configuration file format is:

           option = value

     with each option/value pair separated by a newline.

     The following command-line options are required:

           -i input file

           --input-netflow input file
                   Specify the netflow input file. In this case the
                   netflows as defined by ARL accepted.

           -o output file

           --output output file
                   Specify the output file. This is the file that
                   will be used by other symptoms if needed.
                   FrequentRebootsV program can be used to view those
                   entries without reprocessing the input.

     The following command-line options are optional:

           -c configuration_file

           --config-file configuration_file
                   Specify the file from which to read additional configuration
                   options.

           -h

           --help
                   Print a help message to stdout.

           -s

           --stdout
                   By default the symptom will output its finding to stdout
                   in human readable format. This option will disable this
                   feature.

           -n

           --sensor
                   Specify the sensor name, optional but recommended as
                   NetFlow file doesn't contain this name.


           -d

           --state-dir
                  Directory that will contain state files. Those
                  should be from the previous execution of the
                  program. Due to these files the program must be
                  executed with sequential inputs. Default: "./"

           -a

           --app-def
                 Application definition file. This file defines
                 initiation events. Default:
                 "/usr/local/etc/boot_applications.conf"

           -e

           --events-at-reboot
                 How many initialization events needed to mark a
                 reboot. Events as defiled but --app-def file.
                 Default: 3

           -b

           --boot-time-window
                 Defined in seconds. How long does it take for a
                 host to boot. More precisely, in what time window
                 -e value of events need to happen to mark a reboot.
                 Default: 300 (5 mins)

           -r

           --reboot-count
                How many reboots are needed to flag the host.
                Default: 5

           -w

           --watch-time
                Defined in hours. Time window for watching the
                reboots of a host. Default: 24



     The following configuration-file options are available:

           state-dir = file
                   see: --state-dir

           app-def = file
                   see: --app-def

           events-at-reboot = number
                   see: --events-at-reboot

           boot-time-window = number
                   see: --boot-time-window

           watch-time = number
                   see: --watch-time

           reboot-count = number
                   see: --reboot-count

     The application definition file uses a format similar to the
     configuration file:

           Application="[IP] [PORT] [Comment without spaces]"
                   this is the line for defining IP based Host
                   Initialization Event. Ex: "72.247.146.18 80
                   Panda_Antivirus"

           Application_dns="[DNS] [PORT] [Comment without spaces]"
                   This is the line for defining DNS based Host
                   Initialization Event. Ex: "dmzs.com 123
                   Time_Server_dmzs.com"

EXIT STATUS
     FrequentReboots exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Process an hour worth of traffic:

           ./FrequentReboots -i ./arl/ARL-sample/idata_1/20071003.05.flow
                        -o output -f ./state/
