SYNOPSIS
     DarkAccess [-c configuration_file]
                    [[-t value] | [--time-window value]]
                    [[-s] | [ --stdout ]] [[-z value] | [--zone value]]
                    [[-f file] | [--state-file file]]
                    [[-n value] | [--sensor value]]
                    -i netflow_file
                    --input-netflow netflow_file -o output_file
                    --output output_file
     DarkAccess -h

DESCRIPTION
     DarkAccess program scans through the netflow data file to flag
     connections where a client connects to a server, within the
     monitored zone, that has not connected out of the zone.

     If configuration_file is not specified, the default configuration
     file location is /usr/local/etc/symtoms.conf.

     The configuration file format is:

           option = value

     with each option/value pair separated by a newline.

     The program will accept the zone value through the
     configuration file or through the command line. This value is
     required through one of the methods.

     The following command-line options are required:

           -i input file

           --input-netflow input file
                   Specify the netflow input file. In this case the
                   netflows as defined by ARL accepted.

           -o output file

           --output output file
                   Specify the output file. This is the file that
                   will be used by other symptoms if needed.
                   DarkAccessV program can be used to view those
                   entries without reprocessing the input.

     The following command-line options are optional:

           -c configuration_file

           --config-file configuration_file
                   Specify the file from which to read additional configuration
                   options.

           -h

           --help
                   Print a help message to stdout.

           -s

           --stdout
                   By default the symptom will output its finding to stdout
                   in human readable format. This option will disable this
                   feature.

           -t

           --time-window
                   Specify the time window for the Darkspace Access
                   scan. Default is 24. The value is in hours. The
                   value is used to determine how long a host
                   considered "not dark" after it has made a
                   connection outside of the monitored zone.

           -z

           --zone
                   Specify the monitored zone. ex: 192.168.1.2/24 or
                   2001:480:60:55::3/96

           -f

           --state-file
                   Specify the state file from previous execution or a
                   new file. State file is need store data between
                   executions. It is important that the data is
                   processed in sequential time. Meaning netflows
                   should be provided in the other they were
                   recorded (ie. 1200, 1300, 1400, etc).

           -n

           --sensor
                   Specify the sensor name, optional but recommended as
                   NetFlow file doesn't contain this name.



     The following configuration-file options are available:

           time-window = number
                   Same as the command line argument.

           zone = subnet
                   This can be a list of subnets separated by a
                   space character. Specified in the same way as the
                   command line argument.

EXIT STATUS
     DarkAccess exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Process an hour worth of traffic:

           ./DarkAccess -i ./arl/ARL-sample/idata_1/20071003.05.flow
                        -o output -f ./state/file -z '192.0.0.0/24'
