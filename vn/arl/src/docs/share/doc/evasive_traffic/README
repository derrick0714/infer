EvasiveTraffic(1)  Vivic Networks Command

NAME
     sym_main_EvasiveTraffic - search for evasive traffic in input data

SYNOPSIS
     EvasiveTraffic [-c configuration_file]
                    [[-t value] | [--ttl-value value]]
                    [ [-s] | [ --stdout ]] -i netflow_file |
                    --input-netflow netflow_file -o output_file |
                    --output output_file
     EvasiveTraffic -h

DESCRIPTION
     EvasiveTraffic program scans through the netflow data
     file to flag those flows that exhibit the characteristics of
     being evasive.

     If configuration_file is not specified, the default configuration file
     location is /usr/local/etc/symtoms.conf.

     The configuration file format is:

           option = value

     with each option/value pair separated by a newline.

     The program will accept the ttl value through the configuration file
     ('ttl-value' option name) or the command line. The command line
     option will take precedence over the value in the configuration file.

     The following command-line options are required:

           -i input file

           --input-netflow input file
                   Specify the netflow input file. In this case the
                   netflows as defined by ARL accepted.

           -o output file

           --output output file
                   Specify the output file. This is the file that
                   will be used by other symptoms if needed.
                   EvasiveTrafficV program can be used to view those
                   entries without reprocessing the data.

     The following command-line options are optional:

           -c configuration_file

           --config-file configuration_file
                   Specify the file from which to read additional configuration
                   options.

           -h

           --help  Print a help message to stdout.

           -t ttl value

           --ttl-value ttl value
                   Specifies the TTL threshold. 10 is default. This
                   option overrides the value read from the
                   configuration file.

           -s

           --stdout
                   By default the symptom will output its finding to stdout
                   in human readable format. This option will disable this
                   feature.


     The following configuration-file options are available:

           ttl-value = number
                   Specify the threshold for the ttl value.

EXIT STATUS
     EvasiveTraffic exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Process an hour worth of traffic:

           ./EvasiveTraffic -i ./idata_1/20071003.05.flow
              -t 11 -c ./test-c.cfg -o ev_traff.out
