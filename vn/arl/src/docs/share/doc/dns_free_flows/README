                    [[-d value] | [--dns-timeout value]]
                    [[-s] | [ --stdout ]]
                    [[-f file] | [--state-file file]]

                    -i netflow_file | --input-netflow netflow_file
                    -p pcap_file | --input-pcap pcap_file
                    -o output_file | --output output_file
     DNSFreeFlows -h

DESCRIPTION
     DNSFreeFlows program correlates netflow data files and corresponding pcap
     files to flag those connections where a client connects to a server
     without first looking up the IP address.

     If configuration_file is not specified, the default configuration
     file location is /usr/local/etc/symtoms.conf.

     The configuration file format is:

           option = value

     with each option/value pair separated by a newline.

     The following command-line options are required:

           -i input file

           --input-netflow input file
                   Specify the netflow input file. In this case the
                   netflows as defined by ARL accepted.

           -p input file

           --input-pcap input file
                   Specify the pcap file. It is expected that this
                   file will contain DNS packets for the same
                   timeframe as entries in the netflow input file.

           -o output file

           --output output file
                   Specify the output file. This is the file that
                   will be used by other symptoms if needed.
                   DNSFreeFlowsV program can be used to view those
                   entries without reprocessing the input.

     The following command-line options are optional:

           -c configuration_file

           --config-file configuration_file
                   Specify the file from which to read additional configuration
                   options.

           -h

           --help
                   Print a help message to stdout.

           -s

           --stdout
                   By default the symptom will output its finding to stdout
                   in human readable format. This option will disable this
                   feature.

           -d

           --dns-timeout
                   Defined in hours. Default value is 24. This is
                   the duration that a DNS resolution is considered
                   valid. If a connection is made to the resolved IP
                   within this time frame then the connection will
                   not be flagged.

           -f

           --state-file
                   Specify the state file from previous execution or a
                   new file. State file is need store data between
                   executions. It is important that the data is
                   processed in sequential time. Meaning netflows
                   should be provided in the other they were
                   recorded (ie. 1200, 1300, 1400, etc).

           -n

           --sensor
                   Specify the sensor name, optional but recommended as
                   NetFlow file doesn't contain this name.



     The following configuration-file options are available:

           dns-timeout = number
                   Same as the command line argument.

EXIT STATUS
     DNSFreeFlows exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Process an hour worth of traffic:

           ./DNSFreeFlows -i ../ARL-sample/poly-source/20091207.19.flow
                          -p ../ARL-sample/poly-source/pcap/arl_sample.td0
                          -o output -d 10
